<p> Today's Question?

Why the army interferes in politics, what is the reason for their influence?

It is said that the Prime Minister of Pakistan is the second most powerful leader. And the country's most powerful leader is actually the army chief.It is also said that Pakistan's foreign and defense policy is right at the army headquarters, where the civilian prime minister has no authority.Whenever a civilian government is in power in Pakistan, whatever the political party, they have to come to a compromise with the Pakistani army.But why is the military so influential in the country's politics - explains the BBC's Munni Akhter.
